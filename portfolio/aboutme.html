                Hi, I'm Nate Bowers and I love skiing.
                Ever since I was put on skis at 2 years old,
                I have spent countless winters in the mountains shredding.
                I love to ski with my family, especially my brother,
                who is always outperforming me and drives me to get better.
                My main focus is big mountain skiing but I am proficient in both
                park and racing. My home mountain is Squaw Valley in Tahoe.
                I have also spent significant time at Alpine Meadows(Tahoe),
                Deer Valley(Utah), Alta(Utah), and Snowmass(Colorado).
                <br><br>
                My ski rolemodel is Chris Benchetler. He is an amazing backcountry skier and artist.
                He has his own line of big mountain skis and I regularly use them.
                Chris can be found driving all over the USA in his custom sprinter van and skiing any chance he gets.
            </p>
